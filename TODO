Build Dotty:

sbt dotty-bootstrapped/publishLocal

Testing Dotty:

All JDK >= 8 should work
Our CI only tests 8 and 11
I don't know what's going on in your build, try doing a clean from sbt
test will not run bootstrapped-only tests like tasty-inspector, you need dotty-bootstrapped/test
You can run a single test like this: dotty-bootstrapped/testCompilation tasty-inspector


Results:
JDK13: ~17 build failures with 1000s of warning messages
JDK11: 3 build failures
JDK8:  2 failures
